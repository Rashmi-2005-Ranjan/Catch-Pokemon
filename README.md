Catch-Pokemon
Overview
Catch-Pokemon is a dynamic web application built with React.js that allows users to explore, search, and view Pokémon details by fetching data from the PokéAPI. The application features a responsive UI styled with pure CSS (no Tailwind or Bootstrap), implements modern JavaScript concepts like async/await, Promise.all, and robust error handling, and leverages React hooks for state management and side effects.
Features

Pokémon Listing: Displays a grid of Pokémon cards with names, images, and types fetched from the PokéAPI.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search for Pokémon by name with real-time filtering.
Loading State: Shows a loading indicator while fetching data to enhance user experience.
Error Handling: Gracefully handles API errors and displays user-friendly error messages.
Responsive Design: Clean and interactive UI styled with custom CSS, optimized for various screen sizes.
API Data Handling: Efficiently fetches and processes data using async/await and Promise.all for parallel requests.
React Hooks:
useState: Manages Pokémon data, search input, loading, and error states.
useEffect: Handles side effects like fetching data on component mount or search updates.


Array Methods: Uses map to render Pokémon cards and filter for search functionality.

Technologies Used

React.js: Frontend library for building the user interface.
JavaScript (ES6+): For modern JavaScript features like async/await, arrow functions, and destructuring.
PokéAPI: Public API for fetching Pokémon data.
CSS: Custom styles for a polished and responsive UI.
Fetch API: For making HTTP requests to the PokéAPI.
React Hooks: useState and useEffect for state management and lifecycle handling.

Implementation Details
API Data Fetching

PokéAPI: The app fetches Pokémon data from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/.
Async/Await with Promise.all: 
Uses async/await for clean asynchronous code.
Promise.all is used to fetch detailed Pokémon data (e.g., images, types) in parallel for better performance.
Example:const fetchPokemon = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20');
    const data = await response.json();
    const pokemonDetails = await Promise.all(
      data.results.map(async (pokemon) => {
        const res = await fetch(pokemon.url);
        return res.json();
      })
    );
    return pokemonDetails;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch Pokémon data');
  }
};





State Management

useState Hook:
Manages pokemonList for storing fetched Pokémon data.
Tracks searchQuery for filtering Pokémon by name.
Controls isLoading and error states for UI feedback.


useEffect Hook:
Fetches Pokémon data on component mount.
Re-runs when searchQuery changes to update the filtered list.
Example:useEffect(() => {
  const loadPokemon = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      const data = await fetchPokemon();
      setPokemonList(data);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };
  loadPokemon();
}, []);





Search Functionality

Uses the filter method to match Pokémon names against the searchQuery.
Case-insensitive search for better user experience.
Example:const filteredPokemon = pokemonList.filter(pokemon =>
  pokemon.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
);



Usage

View Pokémon: On page load, the app fetches and displays a list of Pokémon.
Search Pokémon: Type a Pokémon's name in the search bar to filter the list in real-time.
Interact with Cards: Hover over Pokémon cards to see interactive hover effects.
Handle Errors: If the API is down or a request fails, an error message will be displayed.

Future Improvements

Pagination: Add support for loading more Pokémon with infinite scroll or pagination.
Detailed View: Implement a modal or separate page for detailed Pokémon stats.
Local Storage: Cache API results to reduce requests and improve performance.
Advanced Filtering: Allow filtering by Pokémon type or other attributes.
